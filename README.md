Top_50_Spotify_Tracks_of_2020

Context
Imagine that you are a data analyst working for Spotify. Your team is responsible for content analysis, and in this quarter, you have decided to analyze Spotify's top hits and quantify what makes a hit song. Your team's product manager has many ideas and prepared a list of questions (requirements) that she wants you to get answers to. After reviewing the list of over 20 questions, you are not in a good mood - you'll have to work a couple of days to get all the answers. Luckily, a few days ago, an experienced data scientist working in your team queried the top 50 tracks for her machine learning project and agreed to share the data with you. This is a significant help - your SQL skills are not too sharp yet, and you don't yet know where to find all the relevant tables in your data warehouse. With this dataset, you are confident that you'll be able to answer all your PM's questions and maybe even look into some things that she didn't ask for.

Objectives for this Part
Practice working with data from Kaggle.
Practice performing basic EDA.
Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas.
Requirements
Download the data from Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 dataset.
Load the data using Pandas.
Perform data cleaning by:
Handling missing values.
Removing duplicate samples and features.
Treating the outliers.
Perform exploratory data analysis. Your analysis should provide answers to these questions:
How many observations are there in this dataset?
How many features this dataset has?
Which of the features are categorical?
Which of the features are numeric?
Are there any artists that have more than 1 popular track? If yes, which and how many?
Who was the most popular artist?
How many artists in total have their songs in the top 50?
Are there any albums that have more than 1 popular track? If yes, which and how many?
How many albums in total have their songs in the top 50?
Which tracks have a danceability score above 0.7?
Which tracks have a danceability score below 0.4?
Which tracks have their loudness above -5?
Which tracks have their loudness below -8?
Which track is the longest?
Which track is the shortest?
Which genre is the most popular?
Which genres have just one song on the top 50?
How many genres in total are represented in the top 50?
Which features are strongly positively correlated?
Which features are strongly negatively correlated?
Which features are not correlated?
How does the danceability score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?
How does the loudness score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?
How does the acousticness score compare between Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie genres?
Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results you got, and what these results mean.
Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
Evaluation Criteria
Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?
Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the correct levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented-out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?
Code performance. Did you use suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?
Project Review
During your project review, you should present your project as if talking to a product manager and senior data analyst working in your team. You will have to find the right balance between explaining the business side and the technical aspects of your work. You can assume that both of your colleagues have a strong understanding of and are very interested in the business aspect of your project, so be sure to clearly explain what new insights you've found while analyzing the dataset and which directions look the most promising for further research. However, you should also spend time explaining the technical aspects of your work, especially the more complex or unconventional choices.

During a project review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.

What advantages do NumPy arrays have over Python lists?
What makes computation on NumPy arrays so fast?
What are the rules of broadcasting?
What advantages do Pandas have over NumPy?
What is a DataFrame in Pandas?
